NI Linux Real-Time OS Image/Package Building Component

This component provides the documentation and sources to build the OS image
or packages for installation for NI Linux Real-Time controllers. To follow
these instructions, familiarity with git and building software on Linux is
highly recommended.

Currently, you are on the "master" branch. Check out the branch that
corresponds to the version of LabVIEW installed on your controller and read
the documentation in that branch. The documentation for each NI software
release is included in the branch for that software release. For example,
if you want information about building a package or the kernel for a controller
that has the LabVIEW 2014 software stack, check out the 14.0 branch.
